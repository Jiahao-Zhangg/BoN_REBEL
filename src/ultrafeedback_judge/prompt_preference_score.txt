Based on the provided input instruction and two sample responses from a worker, assess the responses based on the following single-criterion question. Determine the response which better answers that questions. For example, the input instruction might be "What is a good vegan substitute to meat for someone allergic to soy and gluten? Provide an answer followed by a factually detailed and humorous one-sentence explanation" and the criterion question might be "Is the explanation factually detailed?". Your selection should be based primarily on the response and the question alone, with the instruction shown for context when needed. There are roughly five levels of response quality:
- 100: Select 100 if the generated text represents an optimal solution that expertly balances all relevant factors mentioned in the question. For objective criteria (like "Does each sentence in the generated text use a second person?"), even minor deviations exclude a 100 rating (and probably lead to a 0 rating). For subjective criteria, the response should basically be perfect. For the example above (about the vegan substitute), and the criterion above (about factual detail), an example 100-point response is "Mushrooms, because they can be easily caramelized and browned, they are rich in the glutamates which lead to incredible umami flavors, they can be cooked into crispy OR chewy meatlike textures.". This response is richly detailed and factual, and though it fails to be humorous, it is still a 100-point response on the factual detail criterion.
- 75: Return ~75 if the generated text very effectively addresses the main requirements but has room for minor improvements. The response should be unconditionally acceptable (at a professional level) but may not be absolutely perfect. There are no mistakes that critically undermine the question. An example 75-point response to the example question above is "Mushrooms - they are rich in the glutamates that lead to incredible umami flavors and they don't look cute in the slightest while alive.". This response has one interesting fact but could be more detailed.
- 50: Opt for 50 if the generated text adequately fulfills the basic requirements but contains notable flaws or missed opportunities for improvement. The response should still be functionally acceptable. The response contains at most one minor inadequacy or inaccuracy related to the question but there are no mistakes that critically undermine the question. An example 50-point response to the example question above is "Mushrooms, because they can be easily caramelized and browned, they're universally beloved by sophisticated palates, and they don't look cute in the slightest while alive." The statement that they're universally beloved by people with sophisticated palates, while potentially true, is vague and not objective.
- 25: Return ~25 if the generated text fulfills the key condition specified by the question and demonstrates awareness of the key requirements but fails to execute them effectively. The text may contain non-critical inaccuracies or irrelevant information. However, if there is even one element that critically undermines the core purpose specified in the question (even if that element seems minor in isolation), the score should be 0 (not 25). An example 25-point response to the example question above is "Mushrooms, because they can be easily caramelized and browned, universally beloved by kids, and they don't look cute in the slightest while alive." The statement that most kids love mushrooms is not objective and potentially false).
- 0: Opt for 0 if the generated text fails to meet the questionâ€™s requirements or provides no information that could be utilized to answer the question. If the response contains a critical error relevant to the question, return a 0. For the question about the vegan substitute, an example 0-point response is "Mushrooms, because they make you question why you ever thought a dead animal could compare to this vegan delight." While funny and engaging, this response contains zero factual detail about mushrooms, critically violating the question.

Given this range of scores, determine which response performs better according to the criteria. Do not assign a specific score to each response. Instead, provide a rating from 0 to 10 indicating how much A is preferred to B.
- 10: indicates that A is overwhelmingly better than B. This should be reserved for when A exactly meets the criteria and B does not meet the criteria at all.
- 6-9: These ratings are for when A is somewhat preferred to B for subjective questions. Ratings closer to 10 indicate A is more preferred.
- 5: indicates that the two responses satisfy the question equally. This should primarily be used when there is no subjectivity in the question, and both prompts pass or both prompts fail.
- 1-4: These ratings are for when B is somewhat preferred to A for subjective questions. Ratings closer to 1 indicate B is more preferred.
- 0: indicates that B is overwhelmingly better than A, the opposite of 10.
You should use your judgment to determine the most appropriate response. Focus on the posed question and ignore other aspects of response quality not implied by the question. Return only a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive)- do not include any other text in your response.
